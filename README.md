# Next.js 15 Server Component Deep Nesting Data Fetching Error

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in Next.js 15 related to deeply nested data fetching within server components.  The bug manifests as a stack overflow error (`Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded`) or incomplete data rendering when fetching data with excessive nested relationships. This is particularly relevant when dealing with complex data structures or recursive data fetching.

## Bug Description

The `serverComponentBug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  It attempts to fetch data with a structure that requires a very deep level of recursion.  This can lead to exceeding server-side execution limits or reaching the maximum call stack size.

## Solution

The `serverComponentBugSolution.js` file offers a solution that uses data normalization, pagination, or other techniques to reduce the depth of the data fetching process.  This mitigates the risk of stack overflows and ensures that the data is fetched efficiently without exceeding resource limits.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the error in the `serverComponentBug.js` example.
5. Compare to the corrected behavior in `serverComponentBugSolution.js`.
