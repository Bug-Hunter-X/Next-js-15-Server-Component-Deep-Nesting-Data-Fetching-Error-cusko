In Next.js 15, a relatively uncommon bug can occur when using server components with deeply nested data fetching.  Imagine you have a component that fetches data, and that data contains references to other data that needs to be fetched. If this nesting goes too deep, you might hit a recursion limit or exceed execution time limits on the server, leading to errors like `Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded` or incomplete data being rendered on the client.
